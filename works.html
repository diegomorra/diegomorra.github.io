		<div id="descrizione" class="descrizione_text">“COBO: a phygital interactive toolkit for co-designing smart interactive experiences with people with Intellectual disability” is the result of an extraordinary collaboration between Politecnico di Milano and Fraternità ed amicizia onlus. The master's thesis reports the full process, starting from the preliminary phase of research and experimentation, which led to the design and development of an interactive co-design toolkit intended for cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation within therapies with people with intellectual disabilities. The toolkit contributes to the research process concerning the introduction of innovative technologies in the relationship between therapists and patients. The project also further investigate the potential associated to the development of phygital (i.e digital and physical) technologies and interfaces as a solutions capable of stimulating attention, engagement and sense of empowerment of people with intellectual disabilities by also facilitating active participation in cooperation, socialization and self-reflection processes related to indivisuals needs in relation to external environment. </div>

		<div  class="descrizione_text">COBO is phygital interactive toolkit for co-designing interactive outdoor experiences and intended for people with intellectual disability. The toolkit consists of an interactive board and a dedicated tablet application, with which the user can interact during all stages of the game and which is able to provide information and advice. The interactive board is able to recognize the card combinations made by users and permits to test them through a series of interactive functions, which make the effects on reproductions of the park elements visible. In COBO, next to the figure of the mayor, as the moderator of the game, a new virtual character appears, Virginia, a voice assistant able to support the player in the learning of the game and also able to guide her/him through all the various phases to the definition of the final idea. </div>

The installation was part of the “Mediazioni Algoritmiche“ exhibition organized at @polimi from February to March 2020. Italy is a country with a great amount of abandoned historical buildings: architectural wonders of which only a few people know the exact location. An ISTAT census on disused buildings allows to get an idea of where these structures are more concentrated. The first step towards their rediscovery. Concrete is the perfect material to represent the reality of facts. Just as buildings are slowly eroded by time so even the blocks that represent each region are more or less eroded and in a state of degradation based on the amount of unused buildings in the region.

		<div  class="titolo_text">GIUOCO DELLE PERLE DI VETRO</div>
		<div  class="descrizione_text">"Il giuoco delle perle di vetro" is a philosophical and fantastic novel written by Herman Hesse in 1943. The book tells the life of Josef Knecht: a little orphan whose skills are noted by a music teacher who i will allow you to be admitted to Castalia, a city run by an order of intellectuals only, where Knecht will reach the highest offices. In the novel the role of the game of pearls is central, an imaginary game based on mental connections between opposite opposite. This imaginary game was the starting point for the design of an accessible Booktrailer, designed to advertise a hypothetical new edition of the book. The trailer was realized through utilizing an abstract geometric imaginary made of 3D models made with Cinema 4D and After Effects. Later, an accessible version has been created for the deaf and blind through a LIS interpreter and color translation of the video music.

		<div  class="titolo_text">SOLO LA LUCE</div>
		<div  class="descrizione_text">"Solo la luce." is a photographic series that arises from the experience that, during the last years, I have lived during my travels looking for abandoned buildings throughout northern Italy, not only for photograph them but also to see those that define "forgotten architectural wonders" .These places, this silence, this absence of life where life once erected and frescoed walls , gives the feeling that, walking inside them, the light that filters from a window, from a torn roof, from a crack in the wall, it's the only presence, intangible but at the same time always present. This was the inspiration for the birth of this project, where these places are the main subject, but the same is also the light that, between these rooms, these forgotten spaces, takes human shape, elegant and luminous, remaining a part of the enviroment, part of a balance of light and shadow that  born and dies every day.
